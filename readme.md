# Langchain Fundamentals

## What is Langchain?

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models. It gives you different prompting templates, output parsers to get desired outputs and much more.

## Get Started

- Create a `.env` file with an env variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` which will be obtained from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

- Use the notebook while installing the necessary libraries along the way mentioned in the notebook.
